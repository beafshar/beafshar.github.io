### 🌟 About Me

I'm Bahar Emami Afshar, a machine learning engineer and researcher passionate about building intelligent, explainable, and efficient AI systems. My most recent work focuses on fraud detection in financial systems, explainable AI (XAI), anomaly detection, and data-efficient learning techniques like active and semi-supervised learning.

Over the past year, I’ve developed frameworks such as **X-ITERADE** and **ALISA**, which have been published in international conferences and contributed to a patent in collaboration with H3M Analytics Inc. I enjoy designing practical AI solutions that make a real-world impact — especially in high-stakes, low-label environments.

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a company working on real-world AI problems, or just curious about my work, feel free to explore and connect!
