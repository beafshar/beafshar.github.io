# 👋 Hi, I'm Bahar Emami Afshar

I’m a machine learning engineer with a strong research focus on fraud detection, explainable AI, and data-efficient learning. My recent work includes developing X-ITERADE (published at Discovery Science) and ALISA (under review), frameworks that combine unsupervised learning, semi-supervised techniques, and large language models.
