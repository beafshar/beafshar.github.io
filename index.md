Welcome to my website!

I'm Bahar Emami Afshar, a machine learning engineer and researcher passionate about building intelligent, explainable, and efficient AI systems. My most recent work focuses on fraud detection in financial systems, explainable AI (XAI), and data-efficient learning techniques like active and semi-supervised learning.

Over the past year, I’ve developed frameworks such as **X-ITERADE** and **ALISA**, which have been published in international conferences and contributed to a patent in collaboration with H3M Analytics Inc. I enjoy designing practical AI solutions that make a real-world impact — especially in high-stakes, low-label environments.

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a company working on real-world AI problems, or just curious about my work, feel free to explore and connect!
