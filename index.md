### 🌟 About Me

I'm Bahar Emami Afshar, a machine learning engineer and researcher passionate about building intelligent, explainable, and efficient AI systems. My most recent work focuses on fraud detection in financial systems, explainable AI (XAI), anomaly detection, and data-efficient learning techniques like active and semi-supervised learning.

Over the past year, I’ve developed frameworks such as **X-ITERADE** and **ALISA**, which have been published in international conferences and contributed to a patent in collaboration with H3M Analytics Inc. I enjoy designing practical AI solutions that make a real-world impact — especially in high-stakes, low-label environments.

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a company working on real-world AI problems, or just curious about my work, feel free to explore and connect!

### 🛠️ Projects

- **[Research Paper Summarizer (Python, Streamlit, LangChain, MLflow, Docker, GitHub Actions, Azure App Service)](https://github.com/beafshar/paper-summarizer)** — Developed and deployed an AI-powered tool that ingests academic PDFs and generates concise, structured summaries using LangChain and OpenAI; integrated MLflow for experiment tracking on DagsHub, containerized with Docker, automated builds via GitHub Actions, and deployed on Azure Web App for scalable, cloud-based access. 
- **[Semi-Supervised Bank Marketing (Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, XGBoost, LGBM)](https://github.com/beafshar/SSL_Comparison)** — Benchmarked semi-supervised models on imbalanced marketing data using XGBoost and LightGBM, improving accuracy from 76% to 88% through confidence-based pseudo-labeling and resampling strategies.  
- **[Online Intrusion Detection (Python, Pandas, Numpy, Apache Kafka, Stream Processing)](https://github.com/beafshar/OnlineLearningID)** — Developed a real-time intrusion detection system with online learning, achieving 87% F1-score by adapting to data drift in streaming network traffic.
- **[Persian Twitter Sentiment Analysis (Python, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas)](https://github.com/beafshar/Sentiment-Analysis)** — Implemented 3-class sentiment classification on Persian tweets labeled via emojis, combining FastText embeddings, TF-IDF features, and Bidirectional GRU networks. Applied class weighting and resampling to handle severe class imbalance, boosting accuracy by 10%.
- **[COVID Lung X-Ray Detection (Python, Numpy, Pytorch, Tensorflow)](https://github.com/beafshar/COVID-X-Ray-Classifier)** — Built CNN from scratch and benchmarked on PyTorch/TensorFlow, achieving 94% accuracy on COVID detection from chest X-rays with data augmentation.  
- **[IMDB Clone (Full-Stack Development, Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, React, Docker, Kubernetes)](https://github.com/beafshar/IEMDB)** — Full-stack React + Spring Boot application, containerized with Docker and Kubernetes, featuring user ratings, watchlists, comments, and a collaborative filtering recommender system.  
- **[Pet Clinic Testing (Java)]()** — Applied unit, integration, and system testing with JUnit and mocking on a Java pet clinic app, practicing TDD for maintainability and thorough coverage.
- **[PriceFinder (C++)](https://github.com/beafshar/Multiprocess-Pipeline)** — Parallel C++ program to find lowest prices across shops.
- **[PhonePriceClassifier (C++)](https://github.com/beafshar/Parallel-Programming)** — Classifies phone prices using multithreaded design.
